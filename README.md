## Project Description:
This project will utilize healthcare data from stroke patients to gather extensive clinical data. The collected data will be anlyzed and build the machine learning model to understand which features (gender, age, hypertension, and etc) mainly determine the potiontail of strokes. The analysis will include the correlation between each features and targeted result (have stroke or not). The project will provide valuable insights for doctors, clinical studies, and the general public health on the effects and prevention of strokes. Pandas, maplotlib, and SQL will be utilized to visualize the stroke predictions. 

## Questions to ask:
1. What Socioeconomic status of people will have a higher chance of strokes?
2. Will analyzing data reveal that strokes are affected by marriage?
3. Do smokers have a higher risk of having a stroke?
4. Is the their diet affecting their likelihood  of having a stroke?
5. What age is it more expected?
6. Which feature in our dataset impact on the possibility of stroke?
